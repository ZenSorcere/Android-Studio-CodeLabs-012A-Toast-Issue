# Android-Studio-CodeLabs-012A-Toast-Issue
While going through https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-training-layout-editor-part-a?index=..%2F..%2Fandroid-training#0, I cannot get the Toast to display no matter what code variations I attempt. I'm thinking there's some emulator setting that is blocking them from appearing..?
